# Gameplay Overview – Nordic Gleam Core

Nordic Gleam Core restructures Skyrim’s gameplay into a **survival-driven, progression-focused RPG** where preparation, time, and decision-making matter more than raw player level.

Rather than scaling the world around the player, the player must grow **into** the world.

This document explains how the major gameplay systems interact, in the order they are experienced during play.
Each section includes a reference link to the original mod author’s description page on Nexus for further details.

## 1. Survival Begins in the Wild

### **Campfire – Complete Camping System**

Before anything else, living off the land becomes a central theme.

Campfire provides a rich, standalone **camping and outdoor survival system**:

* Build campfires to cook, rest, and avoid exposure
* Craft tents, bedrolls, backpacks, and tools
* Interact with followers around fires
* Collect wood and supplies in the environment

## 2. Harsh Environments Shape Gameplay

### **Frostfall – Hypothermia Camping Survival**

Environmental conditions become a threat, not background flavor.

Frostfall tracks temperature, weather, and exposure in real time:

* Hypothermia and cold water survival mechanics
* Gear and heat sources matter for survival
* Weather and terrain influence your state
* Deep immersive survival effects without excessive tedium

## 3. Early Progression — Survival Defines the Start

### **Skills of Survival**

Survival and physical resilience are built into your progression from the beginning.

Experience affects:

* Endurance for travel and exposure
* Resource management strength
* Environmental resilience
* Overall sustainability in the wild

This makes the first stages of the game less forgiving and more strategic.

## 4. Develop Your Abilities — Skills With Purpose

### **Set of Skills**

Skyrim’s skill system is expanded to reward deliberate investment:

* Skills strengthen through use
* Builds become distinct and specialized
* Power doesn’t arrive automatically

This encourages thoughtful character development over passive scaling.

## 5. Quests Become Progression Drivers

### **QAPP – Quests Award Perk Points**

Completing quests now has mechanical significance:

* Perk points are awarded for quest completion
* Progress is tied to actions, not repetitive grinding
* Narrative engagement is reinforced

This makes questing feel meaningful beyond just story.

## 6. Power Has a Price — The Economy of Growth

### **Buy Stats and Perks**

Getting stronger isn’t free:

* Increasing attributes costs gold
* Perks also cost a finite resource
* Economy and progression are interwoven
* Players must weigh survival vs. strength

Gold becomes strategically important instead of trivial.

## 7. Loot and Equipment Are Organic

### **Unleveled Loot and Minimalistic Gear**

Gear doesn’t magically match your power:

* Loot reflects the world, not your level
* Rare, powerful items exist early but are hard to find
* Progression through gear is discovery-based
* Encourages exploration and risk taking

This reduces artificial scaling and creates a more grounded experience.

---

## 8. The World Ages — Enemies Get Tougher

### **Time-Based Enemy Scaling**

Instead of enemies constantly matching your level, the world evolves over **time**:

* Longer playtime results in harder foes
* Halting progression carries risk
* You must prepare or adapt along the way

This gives the world a sense of organic progression.

---

## 9. Artifacts and Power Play

### **Corruption – Abusing Artifacts Has Consequences**

Magic and powerful items come with consequences:

* Using certain artifacts can corrupt you
* Long-term effects are meaningful
* The price of power becomes part of the story

This encourages careful consideration of powerful tools.

## 10. Resulting Experience

Together, these systems create a gameplay loop where:

* Survival defines the early journey
* Progression is earned through choice and effort
* Quests give real progression rewards
* Loot and enemies reflect an evolving world
* Power always carries weight and consequence

Nordic Gleam Core does not ask *“What level are you?”*
It asks *“Are you prepared?”*

---

## Design Intent Summary

Nordic Gleam Core aims to deliver:

* A **true survival RPG-like Skyrim**
* Reduced reliance on arbitrary scaling
* Tight linkage between progression, economy, and survival
* A world that feels independent and reactive

This is not a power fantasy.
It is a **living, reactive RPG foundation**.
