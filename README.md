# Nordic Gleam Core
![Main Menu](./main-menu.png)

**Nordic Gleam Core** is a large, gameplay-focused Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition modlist foundation built around **Community Shaders and Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**.

Rather than relying on ENB, this list uses modern shader technology and optimized PBR assets to achieve a clean, realistic visual presentation while maintaining **strong performance and stability**. The result is a visually modern Skyrim that does not sacrifice gameplay depth or frame consistency.

Nordic Gleam Core is designed as a **complete gameplay and rendering foundation** — substantial in size, carefully curated, and intended for long-term play or further expansion.

## Visual & Technical Direction

* **Community Shaders–based rendering**
* **Full PBR pipeline** for landscapes, architecture, and world assets
* **2K texture baseline** for optimal balance between fidelity and performance
* No ENB dependency
* Performance-oriented asset selection
* Modern lighting and material response without excessive overhead

This is a **large download**, but every asset is chosen with purpose: visual consistency, modern rendering, and long-term stability.

## Design Philosophy

Nordic Gleam Core follows these core principles:

* **Gameplay First** – Visuals support gameplay, not replace it
* **Modern Rendering, Classic Identity** – Skyrim remains recognizably Nordic
* **Performance-Conscious** – Visual upgrades without unnecessary bloat
* **Meaningful Progression** – Power is earned, not given
* **Survival & Consequence** – Preparation matters
