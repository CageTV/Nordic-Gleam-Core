## Overview

**Nordic Gleam Core** is a **large, gameplay-focused Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition modlist foundation** built around **Community Shaders and a full Physically Based Rendering (PBR) workflow**.

The list modernizes Skyrim’s visuals **without ENB**, while delivering a deeply interconnected gameplay experience centered on **survival, progression, time-based challenge, and consequence**.

This is not a lightweight vanilla+ list — it is a **substantial, performance-conscious foundation** designed for long-term play and expansion.

---

## Visual & Technical Direction

Nordic Gleam Core uses modern rendering technology while maintaining stability and performance:

- **Community Shaders–based rendering**
- **Full PBR material pipeline**
- **2K texture baseline** (performance-oriented)
- No ENB dependency
- Optimized asset selection
- Stable lighting and material response
- Designed for mid-to-high-end systems

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **large download**. Size is intentional and reflects the use of PBR assets and shader-based rendering.

---

## Gameplay Philosophy

Nordic Gleam Core is built on the following principles:

- **Gameplay First** – Systems matter more than spectacle
- **Earned Progression** – Power is never free
- **Time Has Consequences** – The world evolves independently of the player
- **Survival Is Foundational** – Preparation determines success
- **Lore-Friendly** – Skyrim remains recognizably Nordic

---

## Core Gameplay Systems

Nordic Gleam Core reshapes Skyrim into a survival-driven RPG through tightly integrated systems:

- Survival and environmental pressure
- Skill-based character growth
- Quest-driven perk progression
- Unleveled, world-based loot
- World Levels independent of player
- Time-based enemy scaling
- Economic tradeoffs for power
- Artifact corruption and long-term consequences

Detailed breakdowns can be found in **GAMEPLAY.md**.

## Who This Modlist Is For

Nordic Gleam Core is ideal for players who want:

- A modern-looking Skyrim without ENB
- Community Shaders + PBR visuals
- Performance-conscious 2K textures
- Slower, more deliberate progression
- Survival systems that actually matter
- A stable base for future expansion

---

## What This Modlist Is NOT

- ❌ Not an ENB showcase  
- ❌ Not a 4K/8K ultra-HD texture pack  
- ❌ Not a lightweight vanilla+ setup  
- ❌ Not a power fantasy  
- ❌ Not a total conversion  

This is a **systems-driven foundation**, not a visual tech demo.

---

## Project Scope & Intent

Nordic Gleam Core is intended to be:

- A **long-term gameplay foundation**
- A **stable Community Shaders + PBR base**
- Expandable without fighting conflicts
- Suitable for both players and modlist authors

Visuals support gameplay — they do not replace it.
