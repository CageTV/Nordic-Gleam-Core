## Overview

**Nordic Gleam Core** is a **large, gameplay-focused Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition modlist foundation** built around **Community Shaders and a full Physically Based Rendering (PBR) workflow**.

The list modernizes Skyrim’s visuals **without ENB**, while delivering a deeply interconnected gameplay experience centered on **survival, progression, time-based challenge, and consequence**.

This is not a lightweight vanilla+ list — it is a **substantial, performance-conscious foundation** designed for long-term play and expansion.

---

## Visual & Technical Direction

Nordic Gleam Core uses modern rendering technology while maintaining stability and performance:

* **Community Shaders–based rendering**
* **Full PBR material pipeline**
* **2K texture baseline** (performance-oriented)
* No ENB dependency
* Optimized asset selection
* Stable lighting and material response
* Designed for mid-to-high-end systems

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **large download**. Size is intentional and reflects the use of PBR assets and shader-based rendering.

---

## Gameplay Philosophy

Nordic Gleam Core is built on the following principles:

* **Gameplay First** – Systems matter more than spectacle
* **Earned Progression** – Power is never free
* **Time Has Consequences** – The world evolves independently of the player
* **Survival Is Foundational** – Preparation determines success
* **Lore-Friendly** – Skyrim remains recognizably Nordic

---

## Core Gameplay Systems

Nordic Gleam Core reshapes Skyrim into a survival-driven RPG through tightly integrated systems:

* Survival and environmental pressure
* Skill-based character growth
* Quest-driven perk progression
* Unleveled, world-based loot
* Time-based enemy scaling
* Economic tradeoffs for power
* Artifact corruption and long-term consequences

Detailed breakdowns can be found in **GAMEPLAY.md**.

## Who This Modlist Is For

Nordic Gleam Core is ideal for players who want:

* A modern-looking Skyrim without ENB
* Community Shaders + PBR visuals
* Performance-conscious 2K textures
* Slower, more deliberate progression
* Survival systems that actually matter
* A stable base for future expansion

---

## What This Modlist Is NOT

* ❌ Not an ENB showcase
* ❌ Not a 4K/8K ultra-HD texture pack
* ❌ Not a lightweight vanilla+ setup
* ❌ Not a power fantasy
* ❌ Not a total conversion

This is a **systems-driven foundation**, not a visual tech demo.

---

## Project Scope & Intent

Nordic Gleam Core is intended to be:

* A **long-term gameplay foundation**
* A **stable Community Shaders + PBR base**
* Expandable without fighting conflicts
* Suitable for both players and modlist authors

Visuals support gameplay — they do not replace it.
